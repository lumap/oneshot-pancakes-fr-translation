# oneshot-pancakes-fr-translation
This is a fan French translation of OneShot: The Pancakes Episode.

## How to use
Drag the Languages and Pictures folder into the game's directory. Replace the existing files if prompted. If you have other fan translations installed, you may need to manually merge the contents of the .ini files in the Languages folder.

## How to contribute

### Text
The files to fill/check are `Languges/fr.po` and `Languages/internal/fr.po`. The original English string is `msgid "text here"`, the translated string goes to `msgstr "texte ici"`. If you're unsure about a translation, you can leave a comment by prefixing the line with a `# `.

The official OneShot translations (from the Steam version's files) are included in the `Translation Assets/Languages` folder as a reference.

### Pictures
You will need Photoshop for this. The psd files are in the `Translation Assets/Pictures` folder.

The psd files contain the original english file on a layer and the empty file on top. You can translate the text on the empty file. Once you're done, export it as a `png` and place it in the `Pictures/fr/` folder.
